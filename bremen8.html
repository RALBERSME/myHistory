        <h1>Welcome on my ship S.S. Bremen.</h1>
        <h2>
          I am Heinrich Aldoph Ahrens and the captain of this ship. I was born
          in Geestem√ºnde and grew up here in Bremerhaven on the grounds of the
          Rickmers shipyard. My father was a gardener there. At just 14 years of
          age I became a cabin boy on a four-masted barque. I attended the
          Elsfleth nautical school and became a ship's officer for the
          Norddeutscher Lloyd in 1901. I worked for a year in the Imperial
          Navy.<br />
          After the First World War I worked as a merchant for four years. I
          have been sailing again since 1923 and have been the captain of the
          Bremen since 1936. And if you feel like it, you can come to New York
          with us today (22 August 1939). We are sailing via Southampton and
          Cherbourg. Travel with us!
