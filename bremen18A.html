        Imagine you were the captain of the Bremen. <br />What would you do if
        you were on the ship in the middle of the Atlantic and you found out
        that your country had started a war and that the surrounding countries
        that you had to pass through with the ship had declared war on your
        country in return?<br /><br />Each time you click on the ADD button, a
        new box is created for a new idea.
        <u>Just type it into the box and press enter.</u> Your input will be
        saved to localStorage. This way you will be able to compare your ideas
        with the captain plans on the next page.<br />
