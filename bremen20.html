        <h3>
          Back in September we sent all the sailors, except for around 70 crew
          members, on special trains from Murmansk to Leningrad to travel home
          to Germany. This was necessary to ensure that we do not run out of
          food supplies. But our oil supplies for heating and lighting only last
          until the end of October. We are incredibly lucky that a German tanker
          docks in Murmansk at the end of September and we are given permission
          to fill up. <br /><br />On November 30th 1939 Russia attacks Finland
          and has been at war ever since. I want to leave with the ship and am
          asking Germany about a return. <br /><br />On December 6th 1939 we
          finally get permission. They send us a few more men to support us. But
          we will only have 124 men on board in total, so we are thinly staffed.
          The crew is immediately banned from going ashore. <br /><br />On
          December 10th 1939, at 2 a.m., the anchor is lifted. The S.S. Bremen
          leaves the port of Murmansk.<br />There is a thick snowstorm.
          Visibility is poor. The ship moves silently through the sea so as not
          to be recognized. It is not until around 11 o'clock that it becomes
          light. The snow is now so thick that we can no longer see anything.
          The danger of the cliffs and coast is too great. We lower the anchor
          almost silently. But we must get out of here as quickly as possible,
          otherwise we will be betrayed tomorrow morning. More than an hour
          passes before the squall passes. We raise the anchor again and head
          full steam out into the Atlantic. Fortunately, it gets dark again at 3
          o'clock in the afternoon. When we break through the English exclusion
          zone, we stay 40 miles from the coast. Whenever the lookout post spots
          ships in the distance, we change course. The ship is sailing at full
          speed.<br /><br />
          A searchlight flashes in the darkness. This is undoubtedly an English
          ship. We are at least 10 miles away and are sailing with our lights
          off. We hope that the Englishman has not seen us. We change course.
          <br /><br />On Tuesday morning, at around nine o'clock, we are abeam
          of the Kattegat. The German minefield is now drawing closer, which
          will give us protection from English submarines. An aircraft is
          heading towards us from the south. We are relieved to see that it
          belongs to the German Air Force. At around eleven o'clock, it happens:
          we receive the report that a British submarine is four miles ahead. We
          immediately change course and now sail in a zigzag pattern. The
          unpredictability this creates, but also our speed, are our strengths.
          In principle, we could also run over a submarine with the S.S. Bremen
          and thus endanger it, because our ship has 15 bulkheads with 16
          watertight compartments, giving it an unbeatable safety factor.
          <br /><br />At twelve o'clock, we arrive in the German minefield. We
          can end the zigzag course. A German outpost boat is coming towards us.
          We stop the engines. The sea pilot, who is coming with a German
          torpedo boat, comes on board the S.S. Bremen. Only now does he realize
          who we are. We are so well camouflaged by the grey colour. The sea
          pilot's German torpedo boat now takes over our protection, as we still
          might be attacked.<br /><br />
          At 8:30 a.m. we reach the mouth of the river Weser and are safe from
          British submarines due to the shallow water. At 9:18 a.m., 22 nautical
          miles from Bremerhaven, we drop anchor. The next morning we raise
          anchor. A tug from our shipping company accompanies us to our home
          port of Bremerhaven. We are finally home.

          <u>A few words about Captain Ahrens:</u><br /><br />
          He retired in 1941. From 1949 to 1953 he was a member of the 1st
          German Bundestag. In Bremerhaven the Kommodore-Ahrens-Straße (street)
          was named after him. Due to Ahrens' Nazi past (he was a member of the
          NSDAP), additional explanatory signs were added to the street signs in
          2017.<br /><br />

        <h2><u> The sinking of the S.S. Bremen:</u></h2>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>
          The ship was painted in camouflage colors over the next few months and
          converted into troop transport No. 802 for Operation Sea Lion. This
          operation was about the German invasion of Great Britain, which was
          never carried out. <br /><br />
          The British Royal Air Force heard of this new mission and therefore
          tried to sink the ship. The attempts were unsuccessful.
          <br /><br />
          On March 16th, 1941, a fire broke out in the wood-paneled dining room
          of the S. S. Bremen, which had been converted into a mattress storage
          room. It spread throughout the entire ship and got out of control.
          Since the S. S. Bremen was leaning heavily towards the quay, it was
          flooded so that it could right itself and sink in the shallow waters
          of the Weser. This made it easier to recover the machines.
          <br /><br />
          Investigations revealed that the 15-year-old sailor Walter Schmidt had
          set the fire in revenge for a slap in the face that a superior had
          given him. Schmidt was subsequently executed.
          <br /><br />
          In 1946, the Bremen was towed to a sandbank three miles upstream,
          where it was gradually dismantled and scrapped from 1952 onwards.<br /><br />
