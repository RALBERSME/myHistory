        The German government has issued instructions that all German ships must
        either return to Germany or dock at a neutral port.<br />
        In New York, people are wondering whether the S.S. Bremen will even
        arrive. There has been no news from the Bremen for some time. There is a
        great deal of uncertainty, not just among the passengers who want to
        start their journey back to Germany in New York.<br /><br />
