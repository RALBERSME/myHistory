          In the customs office, the US customs officer checks the papers. All
          are in order. US customs officer: We're sorry, we can't clear you yet.
          We still have to search the S.S. Bremen for weapons and contraband.
          That will take a while, because we haven't been provided with any
          additional staff. We finish work at five o'clock.<br /><br />
          At 8 a.m. the next morning, the US Chief Inspector reports. Large
          ocean liners have many corners and niches that are filled with wood.
          US Customs, which was not usual until now, examines everything
          closely. To do this, ship carpenters have to remove the ship's
          paneling with screwdrivers, chisels and hammers. Everything is
          checked. <br /><br />In the engine room, all tanks have to be opened
          and the contents checked. <br /><br />
          In the swimming pool, the floor under the pool has to be checked from
          below. The search continues all day. Then it is 5 p.m. and all customs
          officers leave the ship. <br /><br />The search continues the next
          day. Today, all of the ship's safety equipment is checked. All
          lifeboats have to be launched. The life jackets also have to be
          counted several times, although it is known that the S.S. Bremen will
          have no passengers on board on its return journey to Germany.
          <br /><br />Although everything is in order and no defects are found,
          the ship is not allowed to leave port. The captain and crew cannot
          understand the delays in departure. Every day in port costs the
          shipping company a lot of money for the ship, and the crew is worried
          about what is going on in Europe. <br /><br />Finally, on August 30th,
          1939, the S.S. Bremen received permission from US Customs to depart.
          It would later emerge that US Customs did not allow the ship to leave
          earlier at the request of the British. Time enough for the British to
          place their destroyers and warships from Halifax and Bermuda in
          international waters.<br /><br />
          Due to the lengthy investigation work, the ship lost 36 hours which is
          1.5 days.<br /><br />The anchors are lifted. The S.S. Bremen sets
          sail.<br /><br />The S.S. Bremen is still in the US three-mile zone,
          but it is already being pursued by a coast guard ship and a police
          ship. An airplane is circling above them. Captain Ahrens sees three
          steamers ahead on the port side. One of them is the British passenger
          steamer "California", the others are freighters.....<br /><br />
