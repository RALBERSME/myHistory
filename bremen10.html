        Look, the weather has changed. It is now 6 a.m. on August 23, 2024, and
        we are passing through the Strait of Dover. Tell me, what does the
        conspicuous concentration of so many English warships mean? Destroyers,
        torpedo boats, submarines, minelayers, outpost ships. Just look. Even
        though we are not at war with England, this worries me.<br /><br />
        The port entrances in Southampton and Cherbourg have been severely
        restricted by net closures. We have 1,700 passengers on board and should
        travel to New York and back to Bremerhaven as quickly as possible. There
        is something in the air.
